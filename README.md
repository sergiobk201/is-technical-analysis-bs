# 📉 Is Technical Analysis Complete BS? - Youtube Series

Welcome to this open-source companion project for my [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/@Sergio.Barrientos) where I critically examine the effectiveness of technical analysis using free public financial data, python and critical thinking. 

---

## 🎯 Objective

This project aims to **test, challenge, and break down popular technical analysis strategies**. We’ll explore:

- Common strategies like SMA, RSI, BB, MACD, etc.
- Backtests using historical data
- Compare the strategy performance vs. buy-hold the underlying asset(s) and the SP500
- Takeaways for your own investing journey based on the conclusions made from the data analysis

---

## 🧠 Prior belief

- I personally believe these strategies don't work and that they are complete BS.
- I dislike any 'finance guru' trying to teach you how to make money without doing their due diligence
- I want to test my prior belief with real data in order to get to a posterior belief (Bayes linguo)

## ⚙️ Requirements

To run the notebooks: you need to follow the instructions found in each notebook and install the necessary packages used. 
You could also simply clone the notebook and run it all, but it's better to read the source code from a random dude like me before running it on your computer, right?
